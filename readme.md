# SFML-Platformer
*Work In Progress* - Simple platformer game made to learn SFML

The goal of this project was to learn SFML and move it to OpenGL or Metal in future. Simple "Game Engine" was created in process and I plan to gradually expand it.
Game included does not have any special meaning and (for now) is only a playground for coding exercises:

Todo:
* GameObjects with components,
* Enemies,
* Parallax background,
* Keys, doors, traps etc.,
* Game pause menu,
* Better Collision detection with support for platforms and slides,
* Dynamic resolution,
* Get rid of SFML and move it to OpenGL or/and Metal.

Maps are created using [Tiled](http://www.mapeditor.org/), though no every feature is supported and the file itself must meet some special requirements.

Used [Kenney's](https://opengameart.org/users/kenney) assets.
